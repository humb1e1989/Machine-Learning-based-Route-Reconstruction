# Machine-Learning-based-Route-Reconstruction-Heuristics
## Project Description:
> "In this project, we delved into the optimization of the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)** utilizing heuristic and an innovative scrambling algorithm. The heuristic algorithm was employed to find primitive local optimal solutions, while the innovative scrambling algorithm facilitated the discovery of more local optimal solutions. The optimization process was visualized using 3D graphics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the solution space's variability." <br>

## Key Features and Contributions:

- **Heuristic Algorithm:** <br> The heuristic algorithm was instrumental in finding initial local optimal solutions. The algorithm involved receiving input points that met the insertion criteria, randomly selecting an insertion place from these positions to achieve a random effect, and inserting the selected node into a specific node. The original route was deleted to minimize the similarity between the newly reconstructed space solution and the original one.

- **Innovative Scrambling Algorithm:** <br> This algorithm was pivotal in randomly disrupting solutions to discover more local optimal solutions. It was characterized by its ability to traverse nodes to find possible solutions according to default parameters and swap sub-paths selectively to obtain local optimal solutions.

- **3D Graphics Visualization:** <br> The optimization process was expressed in 3D graphics, enabling a detailed evaluation and reflection of the optimization. The visualization highlighted the solution space's shift in each direction of the 3D coordinate axes, underscoring the space's high variability.

- **Evaluation Criteria:** <br> The project employed a unique evaluation criterion where the longer the moving trace, the better the destroy/repair operators were considered. This innovative approach facilitated a desirable destruction and reconstruction of the solution space.
