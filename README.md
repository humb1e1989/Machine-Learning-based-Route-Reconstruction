# Machine-Learning-based-Route-Reconstruction-Heuristics
## Project Description
> "In this project, we delved into the optimization of the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)** utilizing heuristic and an innovative scrambling algorithm. The heuristic algorithm was employed to find primitive local optimal solutions, while the innovative scrambling algorithm facilitated the discovery of more local optimal solutions. The optimization process was visualized using 3D graphics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the solution space's variability. <br>
